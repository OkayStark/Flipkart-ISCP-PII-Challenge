# PII Detection System - Deployment Strategy

## Project Overview

This document outlines how to deploy the PII detection and redaction system I developed for the Flixkart ISCP security challenge. As a computer science student, I've designed this solution to be practical and implementable using technologies commonly taught in university coursework and available through free/student accounts.

## System Architecture

The PII detection system is built with a simple but effective architecture:

**Core Detection Engine**
- Python application using only standard libraries
- Pattern matching with regular expressions for fast processing
- Handles both individual sensitive data and combinations
- Scans all text fields for hidden sensitive information

**File Processing**
- Reads CSV files with JSON data records
- Outputs standardized CSV format with redaction results
- Includes error handling for malformed data

**Detection Logic**
- Individual sensitive data: Phone numbers, Aadhaar IDs, passport numbers, UPI identifiers
- Combined sensitive data: Names with emails and addresses (when 2+ elements present)
- Text scanning: Finds sensitive data embedded in descriptions and comments
- Location tracking: City and postal code combinations

## Deployment Approaches

Based on my coursework in distributed systems and cloud computing, here are practical deployment options:

### Local Development Setup

For development and testing, the system runs directly on any machine with Python 3.8+. This approach works well for:
- Course assignments and projects
- Small-scale data processing tasks
- Personal use and experimentation
- Learning and skill development

The processing speed handles 1,000-5,000 records per second on typical student laptops, with memory usage staying under 100MB for most datasets.

### Web Application Deployment

Using frameworks learned in web development courses, the detector can be wrapped in a simple web interface:

**Flask/Django Implementation**
Create a web form where users upload CSV files and download processed results. This approach uses concepts from web programming classes and provides an easy-to-use interface for non-technical users.

**Heroku Deployment**
Students can deploy the web version on Heroku's free tier using skills from cloud computing courses. The platform handles basic scaling and provides a public URL for sharing projects.
**Amazon Web Services (Student Account)**
AWS Educate provides free credits perfect for student projects. The detector can run on:
- EC2 t2.micro instances (free tier eligible)
- Lambda functions for serverless processing
- S3 for file storage and processing
- CloudWatch for basic monitoring

Monthly costs typically stay under $10-20 with student credits, making it affordable for academic projects.

**Google Cloud Platform (Education)**
GCP offers $300 in free credits for students. Deployment options include:
- Compute Engine for virtual machine hosting
- Cloud Functions for event-driven processing
- Cloud Storage for data handling
- Cloud Logging for application monitoring

**Microsoft Azure (Student)**
Azure for Students provides $100 in free credits. Services include:
- Virtual Machines for application hosting
- Functions for serverless computing
- Blob Storage for file management
- Application Insights for performance tracking

### Container-Based Deployment

Using concepts from systems programming and DevOps courses:

**Docker Implementation**
Package the application in a Docker container for consistent deployment across different environments. This shows understanding of containerization concepts taught in advanced systems courses.

**Basic Kubernetes Setup**
For students interested in container orchestration, deploy on local Kubernetes clusters using minikube or kind. This shows knowledge of modern deployment practices without requiring expensive infrastructure.

## Security Implementation

Based on cybersecurity coursework principles:

### Data Protection
- Process data in memory only, never store sensitive information permanently
- Use secure coding practices learned in software security classes
- Implement input validation to prevent common vulnerabilities
- Follow principle of least privilege for system access

### Access Control
- Basic authentication for web interfaces using session management concepts
- Simple user roles based on access control principles
- Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- HTTPS for all web communications

### Privacy Compliance
- Design follows GDPR principles learned in ethics and law courses
- Implement data minimization by only processing necessary fields
- Provide audit trails for compliance tracking
- Support data deletion requests

## Performance Considerations

Applying concepts from algorithms and performance analysis courses:

### Optimization Strategies
- Pre-compiled regular expressions reduce processing time
- Efficient string operations minimize memory usage
- Batch processing capabilities for large datasets
- Parallel processing options when hardware allows

### Monitoring and Metrics
- Track processing speed (records per second)
- Monitor memory usage and system resources
- Log error rates and failure patterns
- Measure detection accuracy against test datasets

Simple monitoring can be implemented using Python logging and basic system tools learned in operating systems courses.
